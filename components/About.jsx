      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jonathan Nguyen. I'm a software engineer that is
        currently looking to break into the tech space. I'm based in the Bay
        Area and go to school at UC Santa Cruz. I'm passionate about music,
        technology, and love learning how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus these days is to deepen my knowledge in the different
        languages that software engineering offers. I aspire to be a great full
        stack developer and to do that I am currently expanding my interests in
        frontend development.
